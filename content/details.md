##### Microsoft Teams details

A Team for this course (within IISc) named __Introduction to Algebraic Topology 2023__ has been created. Anyone from IISc can also join using the Team code `u1hkivl`. Assignments will be submitted through Teams. 

There are Teams apps available for Windows, Linux (Debian/Ubuntu and Redhat), Mac, Android and iOS. I would encourage using the Teams chat to ask questions whenever needed.
